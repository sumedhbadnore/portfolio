          Shortsy is a URL shortener platform I designed to go beyond the basics
          of link shortening. It lets users generate QR codes, create custom
          slugs, and monitor reliability at scale. My goal was to deliver
          performance and simplicity while ensuring smooth developer experience
          across environments.
        </p>
        <p className="font-geist_mono tracking-tighter text-gray-400">
          The system uses Redis for ultra-fast lookups, enabling redirect speeds
          as low as 48ms at p95 latency. I engineered collision-free ID
          generation with TTL logic to ensure consistent and reliable link
          creation. On the deployment side, I created streamlined configs for
          local, preview, and production environments, reducing support requests
          by 70%. With CI/CD pipelines and strict validation/error handling in
          backend APIs, Shortsy has maintained 99.9% uptime across 2,000+ active
          links.

          CacheBench started as a way to visualize and compare cache policies
          like LRU, FIFO, and LFU in real-time. I wanted to create a tool that
          could help students, engineers, and researchers benchmark caching
          strategies without writing their own scripts.
        </p>
        <p className="font-geist_mono tracking-tighter text-gray-400">
          The app features a dynamic dashboard built with Recharts, where users
          can run simulations and export results to CSV for further analysis.
          Accuracy was a key goal, so I implemented O(1) operations for
          efficiency and achieved 98% reporting precision. To make it scalable,
          I integrated serverless APIs on Vercel with warmup logic, ensuring
          consistent results across runs. The UI was styled with Next.js and
          TypeScript, while Linux scripting and SSR-safe imports reduced runtime
          issues by 30%.
